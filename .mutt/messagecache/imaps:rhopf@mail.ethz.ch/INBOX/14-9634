Dear all

Unfortunately, the announcement of the software updates was inconsistent: Thursday, Oct. 4, instead of Tuesday, Oct. 4.

As you probably noticed, the updates already ran (on almost all computers) on Tuesday. So you don't have to expect anything new today.

I beg your pardon.

Best regards,
Stephan
