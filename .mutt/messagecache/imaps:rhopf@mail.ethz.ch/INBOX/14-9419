Hoi z=E4me

anbei einige Kommentare-Aenderungen zum Entwurf.
ich glaube es sieht schon sehr gut aus.
Ciao
Edoardo

Part A)

4) Which specific experiments have been carried out to prove the principle =
of the invention or how do you plan to do so (indicate milestones and estim=
ated time frame)?

Deformation modeling has been performed in seven patients.
No proof of concept for the inverse mechanics computation has been performe=
d yet.
We expect that a quantitative proof of principle will require approximately=
 1 year:
It will take approximately 6 months to establish a procedure for 3D mechani=
cal modeling and to create a reliable mechanical model of a stent.
The following determination of a corresponding deformation and stress field=
 from a few (say 10) cases of in vivo imaging will take additional 3 months=
.
Finally, an error analysis should be performed leadign to the level of unce=
rtainity associated with the determined stress field in the biological tiss=
ue adjacent to the implant (additional 3 months).

Part B)

1b) Has the idea behind your invention ever been published, publicly discus=
sed, or patented by others? Pls. provide literature search (and patent sear=
ch if available).

The proposed approach consists of 3 steps:
(i) The reconstruction of the (detailed) geometry of the medical device bef=
ore and after insertion, in order to characterize the in-vivo state of defo=
rmation of the device.
(ii) The mechanical characterization of the device and the determination of=
 a corresponding 3D continuum model.
(iii) The implementation of the information from (i) and (ii) into a numeri=
cal model to derive the stress field at the biological tissue adjacent to t=
he implant.
There are previous publications on (i) and (ii) above.  HERE WE SHOUDL PROV=
IDE A LIST, RAOUL TO SEARCH FOR (ii).
However, the idea behind this invention is mainly represented by step (iii)=
 which was never opublished before, to the best of oru knowledge.

2a) Describe any existing technology in the field of your invention (state-=
of-the art) and/or provide recent review article. What alternatives to your=
 invention do exist in the same field?

A group in Palo Alto recently published two papers proposing a related idea=
: in their work the global load on a vascular stent was estimated based on =
findings in image data and a global force-deformation relationship of the s=
tent [gangu-ly2011a, ganguly2011b].
Several methods were proposed to obtain information on the deformation char=
acteristics of soft biological tissue. Among these are all recent developme=
nts in the field of elastography, elastoimaging [REF]. In addition, a few d=
evices were developed to directly measure the mechanical response of tissue=
 in-vivo [REF; REF; REF]. None of these methods could be used to provide th=
e state of stress in the tissue adjacent to a medical device implanted in t=
he human body.

4) Has any proprietary material (e.g. cell line, antibody, plasmid, compute=
r software, or chemical compound) obtained from outside your laboratory bee=
n used to develop this invention under a restrictive written or oral transf=
er agreement (other than a normal purchasing agreement)? If yes, pls. speci=
fy and attach a copy.

Was ist mit dem verwendeten CoreValve Stent, von dem wir das =B5CT gemacht =
haben? F=E4llt das da drunter? Ein wirkliches Agreement gab es nie, wir hab=
en das Ding =84for good=93 bekommen um damit rumzuspielen. Wir haben aber g=
laub mit Medtronic einen NDA. ICH WURDE DIE GESCHICHTE KURZ ERKLAREN. SIE W=
ERDEN UNS SAGEN, OB WIR DA PROBLEME HABEN (ICH GLAUBE ES WIRKLICH NICHT...)


Part C)

1) What is the commercial use of your invention?
What is/will be the marketable product?

The proposed procedure could be realized within an algorithm to be combined=
 with the software available for analysis of medical images (as part of the=
 MRI or CT system).
It would require creating a databank with the mechanical models of each ste=
nt (but the creation of these mechanical models could also represent a lucr=
ative service provided to the companies producing the implants).
The main commercial product of the invention would be a software providing =
(i) a robust and rapid extraction of the current position of all reference =
points of the implanted device, (ii) the combination with the mechanical mo=
del and  (iii) the real-time visualization of the corresponding stress vect=
or field in the soft tissue.

2) What is the market need that your product fulfils? Why should somebody b=
uy your product?
Knowledge of the stress state caused by the insertion of an implant in the =
adjacent biological tissue forms an integral part of the evaluation of its =
performance. No alternative method for determination of the stress state in=
 soft tissues adjacent to the medical device is available today.

3) What is the estimated market size?
 MICHAEL: Some number related to implanted vascular stents and meshes would=
 be useful here.

4) How long will it take to develop a marketable product and what are the e=
stimated development costs?
Estimation of time and development costs is difficult at this stage.

5) What competitive products exist already?
None

6) Which potential licensees do you know? Name companies and contact person=
s that are active in the field of your invention.
 MICHAEL: any idea? I think here we think about stent producers? or medical=
 imaging software producers?

7) What is or might be the greatest obstacle to the commercial adoption of =
your invention?
Acceptance on the mdeical side. Definition of criteria for exploitation of =
the new information provided by this idea.
