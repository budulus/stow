So, seems you are screwed indeed:

Swisscom has a nice scam going on, many providers have had the same, but
summer 2010 in EU a law has been pushed through on limits on data-bills. Of=
c
Swiss not in the EU, so the law doesn't go for Swiss. Swisscom still works
the scam by having many sneaky ways to up your data:

*For example:**
Actually I had Swisscom, got a 600chf something bill-
Reason, the stupid phone was using "data" to install in the background
updates + once I said to use wireless, I put mode data to off-
The stupid device still used DATA instead.
I called Swisscom to let them know how crap is it that despite me turning
off DATA it's still automatically activate. They suggested to buy a data
option "just in case"....*
*Or this one:*
*The technical support confirmed that the bill amounted to 28.6Mb due to th=
e
fact that Swisscom roaming partnerships force Swisscom to charge a minimum
of 30kb per session (up to a minimum of 300kb per session!!!), and they
consider a session each time the telephone connects to the GPRS network, so
this means that each time that I was checking Google Maps I was being bille=
d
300kb even if I was using 1kb or 2kb maximum, a shameful ripoff. Even if I
kept complaining about this fact pointing out that it=92s not my problem th=
at
Swisscom has such a bad partnership deals of which I were not warned about
at any time, I had to pay the 240Chf extra. *

So people get enormous databills, and at some point they go complain and ge=
t
an *unlimited-package-suggestion* (what they also are after.) In your case,
you didnt complain, they CALLED you to friendly offer the scam after upping
your bills...

Then you find ALL kinds of companies on the internet that throttle, slow
down the heavier users. Unlimited data is a lie: you can't get unlimited
data, the more you use, the more they will slow you down after some amount.
(Even to 5% of normal speed) Some companies say they don't, but they have a
speedcap to start with, so everybody has a bit slower than normal, and as
soon as you go over their invisible data-barrier, they will shut down ports=
,
lower bandwidth and such jokes.)

*There is 2 ways to contradict them, even legally speaking:

1) If they SAY they offer unlimited data, they are still lying. They
obviously see the loophole "You can access unlimited, it is just so tardslo=
w
that you won't get much." But, that is not a loophole at all. If they have
an offer of unlimited data, and everybody takes that offer (hypotetically)
NOBODY woud have much data anymore. So they can't possibly deliver it at
all, still they say they do.

2) Unlimited means "as much as u want/ all you can eat" they LIMIT your
speed, so they LIMIT your data. *

For real. Go get them! Har!

Here is a nice anology to screw up your workbreak:
You pay 10e for a nice breakfast buffet. However, you can only fill your
plate once, you can't stack up or go for seconds. If you do, they will
charge 100e for the next plate. The breakfast buffet is from 7am to 10am.
Then you think: wow Im still hungry after the first plate, but it is very
expensive, you now what? Ill take the offer to pay 40e for the buffet, whic=
h
says I can have unlimited plates of the lovely shit they offer! So next day
you go to the breakfast at 7am, anticipating on a binging spree. Yummie! Yo=
u
get your first plate, it was very yummie, so you go for a second plate.
Omnomnom. But, when you want to get your second plate, you see a huuuuge
line in front of the buffettable. When it is your turn, it is unfortunaly
10am and the buffet is closed. You ended up paying 40e for only one plate.

You see this shit everywhere:
- unlimited sushi eating for 2 hrs: they are tard slow at the service, the
expensive dishes cost extra anyway, yes "sushi" is unlimited, but only this
and that and that one.
- unlimited carpaccio for all the time you want: the first plate is
delicious, the quality of the second plate is so bad you dont want a third.
And ofc, you cant get more if you dont finish your former plate.

pfff oh and there is nothing in their terms of service to state otherwise,
so they really DONT have a loophole.
