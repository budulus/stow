<div>Title</div>
<div>Measurement of the stress state in soft human organs using medical dev=
ices (stent, medical meshes)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Abstract</div>
<div>Based on a detailed characterization of the mechanical behavior of def=
ormable medical devices (stents, medical meshes) it is possible to calculat=
e the force field associated with any deformation of the device. The deform=
ation state of the device after
 implantation can be obtained from high resolution medical images. This inf=
ormation can be combined in order to determine the local stress state in so=
ft tissues adjacent to the medical device. Knowledge of this stress state i=
s important for evaluation and optimization
 of implants performance.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Description:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Essence of the idea: use implants as sensors to measure the local stre=
ss state in internal organs.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Problem to be solved:</div>
<div>Biocompatibility is interpreted today as both, biochemical and biomech=
anical compatibility. Knowledge of the stress state caused by the insertion=
 of an implant in the adjacent biological tissue forms an integral part of =
the evaluation of its performance.
 Examples are:</div>
<div>(i) Medical meshes used as mechanical support in case of pelvic floor =
laxity (prolaps). The mismatch between deformation behavior of the mesh and=
 the one of the surrounding tissue is considered to be the main cause of de=
trimental effects, such as &quot;contraction&quot;,
 &quot;erosion&quot;, [paper J. Deprest et al, IUGA].</div>
<div>(ii) Stent devices for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement. Lo=
cal stress enhancement in the aortic wall originating from stent insertion =
are suspected to be the cause of ....[paper]</div>
<div>(iii) Stent devices for aneurisms, ... a certain level of stress at th=
e interface between stent and wall is required in order to guarantee long t=
erm placement stability of the stent...??[paper?]</div>
<div>Knowledge of the stress state in soft tissues adjacent to the medical =
device is important for&nbsp;</div>
<div>(a) Post-operative evaluation</div>
<div>(b) Operation planning and device selection</div>
<div>(c) Optimization of design of implants</div>
<div>No method for determination of the stress state in soft tissues adjace=
nt to the medical device is available today. Indirect evaluation from corre=
sponding biomechanical simulation is impaired by significant uncertainties =
related to the constitutive behavior
 of biological tissues.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Proposed solution:</div>
<div>The combination of state of the art techniques for medical imaging, im=
age analysis and features reconstruction, mechanical characterization and n=
umerical modeling of implants enable to determine the stress state in soft =
tissues adjacent to the medical
 device. The process consists of the following steps:</div>
<div>1- Medical imaging techniques (MRI, CT?) are used to obtain high resol=
ution images of the implanted device. Recent progresses were reported conce=
rning the visualization of medical meshes [reference] and stents [reference=
].</div>
<div>2- The 3D geometry of the implant is reconstructed from the MRI or CT =
images. The feasibility of a detailed reconstruction of a stent is demonstr=
ated in [reference].</div>
<div>3- The mechanical behavior of the medical device is characterized by p=
erforming a series of mechanical experiments on multiple samples of the dev=
ices. These experiments will involve all relevant loading conditions to def=
ine a reliable 3D constitutive/structural
 model to simulate the mechanical response of the device.</div>
<div>4- A numerical (finite element) model of the device is created based o=
n (i) accurate information on the shape of the (un-deformed) device and (ii=
) the mechanical model determined in 3.</div>
<div>5- A numerical calculation is performed which provides the external fo=
rce field required to deform the device from the reference configuration (4=
) to the implanted configuration (as determined under 2).</div>
<div>6- The force field calculated in 5 corresponds (actio-reactio principl=
e) to the stress vector field acting on the soft tissue adjacent to the imp=
lant.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Concerning previous work:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Paper group Palo Alto:</div>
<div>- different objective (here: stresses in soft tissue; there: loading o=
n stent affecting mechanical integrity of stent)</div>
<div>- different result (here: local forces; there: global forces on stent)=
</div>
<div>- different methods (here: full field determination of implant deforma=
tion, coupled with continuum mechanics model; there: extraction of structur=
al parameters of shape change - curvature, lengthening, torsion -, coupled =
with structural model of stent)</div>
<div>- confirms feasibility of the idea</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The importance of analyzing the state of deformation of the implant af=
ter insertion has been recognized in recent publications (in particular, of=
 the group of Prof. Falk, co-inventor). None of the previous publications h=
owever explicitly proposed the use
 of the information on current implant geometry and prior knowledge on impl=
ant's constitutive behavior for the determination of the local stress field=
 on the adjacent biological tissue. Furthermore, a feasible procedure to ob=
tain the local force field was never
 proposed before.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Commercial potential:</div>
<div>The proposed procedure could be realized within an algorithm to be com=
bined with the software available for analysis of medical images (as part o=
f the MRI or CT system). A databank could be created with the mechanical mo=
dels of each stent, and the creation
 of these mechanical models could be a lucrative service provided to the co=
mpanies producing the implants. A robust and rapid procedure for extraction=
 of the current position of all reference points of the implanted device co=
uld lead to a real-time visualization
 of the corresponding stress vector field in the soft tissue.</div>
