Hi

Three users are affected by a strange loss of data which had to be restored from backup. The symptom was an almost empty K-drive, but the deletion might be more subtle. Therefore, please look over your files and (roughly) check for completeness. Please report problems to mech_it@imes.mavt.ethz.ch .

Unfortunately, the reason of the problem is yet unknown. It is therefore a good idea to manually save crucial new/changed data by copying it to a USB stick every evening. (Restoring unchanged, older data is relatively simple. But current changes can fall between backups and get lost.)

Sorry for this!

Best regards,
Stephan

P.S.: Please inform students working on your projects.
