Found VERY VERY  small lettres, they are NOT in the terms of service, or
special terms of service, or general or whatever. JUST very small and light
grey, hardly visible on the page where they offer the unlimited service:

* In order to maintain service quality for all customers, Swisscom will
reduce transfer speed if a customer exceeds 10GB in one month or will take
other appropriate action. If there are signs of such activity, Swisscom
reserves the right to exclude the subscription from normal private usage.
Roaming charges are incurred for use abroad.

haha.. I will blow it up for u:

This is the only thing. So if you didnt exceed 10gb, ask them what "other
appropriate action" means. I expect they slow you down at 300mb, as the
other companies do.
