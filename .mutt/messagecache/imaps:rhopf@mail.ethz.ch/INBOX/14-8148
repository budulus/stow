Dear ZfM people,

Very unfortunately, the ETH Netbackup system is down. According to informat=
ion from Informatikdienste, this state could continue until next week. Ther=
efore, the backup of file servers currently is impossible.

To assure a reasonable amount of data security,

--> please copy files which you are working on (or which are crucial for yo=
u these days) to your local C-drive, your USB stick or your USB disk - once=
 a day.

I will inform you as soon as Netback is operational again and has saved our=
 data.

Thanks,
Stephan
