It seems that most people here at ETH use firefox and have disabled scripts=
. In result, at least Stefan and I am assuming Arabella, have had trouble u=
sing the tool. If you are using firefox, at the bottom right corner of the =
window you'll see a little icon with an "S" as in Script. Click on it and a=
llow scripts to be executed for www.when2meet. If this still does not work,=
 I'll send out another email with a doodle link.

Thanks,

M
